## Response format
All responses are a JSON string which parses to an object of the following format:
```js
{
  data: [ ... ],
  error: null | {},
  stats: {will eventually include performance data}
}
```
It is worth noting that the data property will always be an array, even if only a single value is requested/retrieved.

The error property will be null if no errors have occurred.
If an error did occur, then the error object will take the following form:
```js
{
  error: '...',
  message: '...',
  statusCode: ###,
  debugData: {custom debug data}
}
```
