# auto-generated api client

Much of the source code for the javascript client is generated by swagger-codegen during the build process (`npm run build`).

## generating the client

The client should be auto-generated after installation via a postinstall build script.  To re-generate the client separately from the build, run `npm run generate-client`.

## modifying the client

- swagger-codegen uses moustache templates to create the generated source code. These templates can be found in _nodapi/swagger-codegen/lib/javascript-template_.
  - swagger-codegen is a java executable that lives in _nodeapi/swagger-codegen/bin/swagger-codegen-cli.jar_. To update this executable, run `npm run-script update-codegen`

## understanding the client API integration
- see `./client-route` to see how the client javascript is made available on the API
