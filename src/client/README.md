##Auto-generated client

Much of the source code for the javascript client is generated by swagger-codegen during the build process (`npm run build`).

To re-generate the client separately from the build, run `npm run generate-client`.

swagger-codegen uses moustache templates to create the generated source code. These templates can be found in _nodapi/swagger-codegen/lib/javascript-template_.

swagger-codegen is a java executable that lives in _nodeapi/swagger-codegen/bin/swagger-codegen-cli.jar_. To update this executable, run `npm run-script update-codegen`
